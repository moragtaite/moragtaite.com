          # Python 2.7 comes by default with the Ubuntu container CircleCI uses.
          # However it doesn't comes with python-dev which is required for installing pip. If not
          # installed there will be an error when installing some package called "wheel". The
          # next two commands fetches the pip install script and installs pip. After installing
          # pip we add pip to the path (so we can subsequently use the command "pip"). This is
          # required because awscli has other dependencies which requires the existence of pip on
          # the path. Finally we install awscli.
          #
          # It should be noted this is a pretty ugly hack to get awscli in a Node container. In
          # CircleCI v1 the images came by default with awscli, so this mess wasn't required.
